Create an Express Rest API which exposes CRUD functionalities for a student/course system. Create a student model which describes student information (student number, password, first name, last name, address, city, phone number, email, program) and also a course model which describes course information (course code, course name, section, semester). The information should be stored in a MongoDB database. Use ref to allow a student document to make a reference to corresponding course document. Provide authentication capabilities using Passport â€“ local strategy.
